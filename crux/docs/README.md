# Welcome to the Oviz documentation

!> Please note that this documentation, especially the references part, is uncompleted. If you have any questions, please try to ask me in person.

The tutorial contains following parts:

- **Part I** introduces the visualization language used in Oviz.
- **Part II** covers topics on writing custom components.
- **Plots and Charts** mainly explains the usage of `XYPlot` and other radical charts.

When you see a live demo like this:

<div class="demo" data-height="250">
// Try uncommenting the 'fill = red' line
// and click the "▶" button
Component {
    Rect {
        x = 50
        y = 50
        width = 100
        height = 100
        // fill = "red"
    }
}
</div>

You can _edit the code_ on the left side and observe the new result after clicking the "▶" button.
